# ML-Project

#### End to End ML Pipeline project with Modular coding

## Problem Statement

### The purpose of this data is to examine the different features and to observe their relationship. The ML model is based on several features of individuals, such as age, physical/family condition, and location, against their existing medical expenses to predict future medical expenses of individuals. This helps the medical insurance company to decide and charge the premium.

### 1. Data Ingestion: 
* Data ingestion is the process by which unstructured data is extracted from one or multiple sources and then prepared for training machine learning models.



### 2. Data Validation:
* Data validation is an integral part of the ML pipeline. It is checking the quality of source data before training a new mode
* It focuses on checking that the statistics of the new data are as expected (e.g. feature distribution, number of categories, etc). 



### 3. Data Transformation 
* Data transformation is the process of converting raw data into a format or structure that is more suitable for model building.
* It is an imperative step in feature engineering that facilitates discovering insights.



### 4. Model Training
* Model training in machine learning is the process in which a machine learning (ML) algorithm is fed with sufficient training data to learn from.



### 5. Model Evaluation
* Model evaluation is the process of using different evaluation metrics to understand a machine learning modelâ€™s performance, as well as its strengths and weaknesses.
* Model evaluation is important to assess the efficacy of a model during initial research phases, and it also plays a role in model monitoring.


### 6. Model Deployment
* Deployment is the method by which we integrate a machine-learning model into the production environment to make practical business decisions based on data.
